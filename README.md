# Twinge
![cover_art](./docs/cover_art.png)

Count up to 67 as a TEAM! How hard could that be? 

The catch - no number clues allowed! Communicate using only vibes, innuendos, and noises - will you feel the Twinge?

Twinge is a co-operative card game inspired by [The Mind](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/the-mind) by Wolfgang Warsch.

Work together to play through a deck of up to 1000 cards in ascending order. Each player has a hand of cards, and anyone can play into the center pile at any time.

Once the cards in hand are played, a new hand is dealt to every player - increasing by one per player every round. Cards are not shuffled back into the deck - and if you can play through all cards you win!

Missing a card will cause the team to lose a life. The game is over if all lives are lost. Adjust the difficulty by giving more or less lives lives, up to 100.

## Tips
Cancel a prepared move by (mouse) moving the away from the pressed area, or holding for 4 seconds (touch & mouse).

Anyone may warn a player by long pressing their nametag for 2 seconds. A second warning in the same round kicks the player from the game.Kicked players' cards are discarded.

Players with red names have disconnected from the game, to help identify whether to kick them or wait for them to rejoin.

It is possible to join mid-game via the room code. You will not be dealt a hand until the next round, and cannot customise your name.
