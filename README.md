# Twinge
This is a co-operative card game based off The Mind by Wolfgang Warsch. Players work together to get through a deck of 10-1000 cards in ascending order. Hands are dealt with increasing size, and cards are played at any time; without replacement. Difficulty may be adjusted by granting up to 100 extra lives to compensate for missing cards out of order.

## Handy Hints
Cancel a prepared move by (mouse) moving the away from the pressed area, or (touch) tapping with a second finger.

Anyone may kick a player by holding their nametag for 2 seconds. This needs to be done twice in one round to confirm the kick. Kicked players' cards are discarded.

Players with red names have disconnected from the game, either kick them or wait for them to rejoin.

It is possible to join mid-game via room code, but without the ability to customise your name. You will not be dealt a hand until the next round.
